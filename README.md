PromptNLP is a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to efficiently develop accurate regular expression (regex) code to extract apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) from clinical notes. Code 3T is the best performing code after adapting the regex to the sleep-related clinical notes from three institutions (combination of sleep study interpretation reports and free-text clinic notes). Expected output should include patient medical record number, procedure date, AHI/AHI4% columns (depending on number of occurences in applied notes), ESS, and narratives that locates where each extracted value was found.
