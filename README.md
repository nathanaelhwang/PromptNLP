PromptNLP is a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to efficiently develop accurate regular expression (regex) code to extract apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) from clinical notes. Code 3T is the best performing code after adapting the regex to the sleep-related clinical notes from three institutions (combination of sleep study interpretation reports and free-text clinic notes). AHI3 code specifically extracts AHI3%, a format intentionally excluded from Code 3T.
